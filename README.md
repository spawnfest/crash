## How to USE

- TODO add description Here
- TODO add UI image with some builds
- TODO add console screenshot with multiple nodes


## Improvements / Missing 

- add more integration / unit tests
- improve error handling inside gensever
- add handle_info to match step errors and block build and return (instance.ex)
- improve data visualization on UI
- add opentelemetry stuff
- TODO
